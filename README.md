# **Diabetes Detection Research**

Welcome to the Diabetes Detection Research repository! This project aims to explore and develop predictive models for diabetes detection using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques. Below is a brief description of the repository structure and usage instructions:

Repository Structure:
code: This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook file (project_notebook.ipynb) where the entire project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, is implemented.

data: The data folder includes the dataset used in the project (diabetesDataset.csv). Additionally, three preprocessed data files (train.csv, val.csv, test.csv) are provided for users who wish to directly run the model without going through the preprocessing steps.

documentations: Any supplementary documents or resources related to the research project are stored in this folder.

Usage Instructions:
Download the Repository:

Clone or download the entire repository to your local machine.
Open and Modify the Notebook:

Navigate to the code folder and open the project_notebook.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Adjust Data Path:

Locate the code cell with the line pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/DS402MLProj/diabetesDataset.csv'). Modify this line to the path where you have stored the diabetesDataset.csv file on your local machine.
Run the Code:

Execute the notebook cells sequentially. If you want to use the preprocessed data directly, insert the code snippet provided before the cell that begins with "Here we preprocess our data...".
Explore and Analyze:

Analyze the results, explore the models, and gain insights into diabetes detection based on the implemented machine learning and deep learning models.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter issues. Happy coding and exploring the world of diabetes detection research!
